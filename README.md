- Create a form input (i.e Bootstrap) and React front-end.
- The form lets you input a string, i.e "sddaf" "sifojew" and register that to a NodeJS backend, MongoDB.
- Locally hosted.

What matters

- You cannot anything but basic boilerplate i.e 'Create React App', Bootstrap forms etc. 
- You can use React, Node, Mongo etc. documentation.
- You can use Google, i.e stackoverflow but will lose points the more you do that.

What doesn't matter:

- Quality of your code
- Annotations
