- Create a form input (i.e Bootstrap) and React front-end.
- The form lets you input a string, i.e "sddaf" "sifojew" and register that to a NodeJS backend, MongoDB.
- Locally hosted.

What matters

- You cannot anything but basic boilerplate i.e 'Create React App', Bootstrap forms etc. 
- You can use React, Node, Mongo etc. documentation.
- You can use Google, i.e stackoverflow but will lose points the more you do that. 

I stated this spec to 3 other applicants (New Delhi, New Delhi, Bengalaru)

What doesn't matter:

- Quality of your code
- Annotations


Times so far

- 1: Completed in 46 minutes. Login form with validation. (username, password). To MongoDB. React and Node.
- 2: Completed in 49 minutes. Login form without validation. Same as above.
- 3: Completed in 1 hour: String input form, React, Node, Mongo.
